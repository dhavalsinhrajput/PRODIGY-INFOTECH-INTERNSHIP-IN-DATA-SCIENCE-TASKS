# PRODIGY-INFOTECH-INTERNSHIP-IN-DATA-SCIENCE-TASKS INFORMATION

Here‚Äôs a structured overview of how you could approach **all five** tasks in the context of a data science internship:

## 1]  **Visualize Distributions (Histogram & Bar Chart)**

* **Objective**: Show how values are distributed for a given variable.
* **Approach**:

  1. Load your dataset (e.g., CSV).
  2. Pick a **continuous** variable (e.g., age) ‚Üí use `plt.hist()` with appropriate bins.
  3. Pick a **categorical** variable (e.g., gender) ‚Üí count categories and use `plt.bar()`.
* **Insights**:

  * Histogram reveals central tendencies, skewness, spread.
  * Bar chart reveals frequency differences among categories.

## 2]  **Data Cleaning & EDA (Titanic Dataset)**

* **Data Cleaning Steps**:

  1. Handle missing values: fill or drop (`Age`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`).
  2. Convert types: strings ‚Üí categories.
  3. Feature engineering: e.g., extract titles from names.
* **Exploratory Analysis**:

  * **Univariate**: distributions of `Age`, `Fare`, `Survived`.
  * **Bivariate**: survival rate vs. `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age` bins.
  * **Multivariate**: use heatmaps of correlation or pairplots to explore interactions.
* **Goal**: Identify which features influence survival‚Äîe.g., women and children had higher survival rates; higher class correlated with higher survival.

## 3]  **Decision Tree Classifier (Bank Marketing Dataset)**

* **Objective**: Predict if a customer will subscribe to a term deposit (`yes`/`no`).
* **Steps**:

  1. Load and clean: encode categorical variables (`job`, `marital`, `education`), handle missing data.
  2. Split data into features X and labels y; split into train/test sets.
  3. Train a decision tree using scikit-learn:

     ```python
     from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
     model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5)
     model.fit(X_train, y_train)
     ```
  4. Evaluate using accuracy, recall, precision, ROC‚ÄëAUC.
  5. Visualize tree structure to interpret predictive rules (e.g., ‚Äúif `duration` > 300 seconds and `housing` is ‚Äúno‚Äù, then more likely to subscribe‚Äù).
* **Goal**: A simple interpretable model that highlights key customer behaviors leading to purchase.

## 4]  **Sentiment Analysis on Social Media**

* **Objective**: Understand public attitudes toward a brand or topic (e.g., tweets).
* **Steps**:

  1. Collect data using APIs (e.g., Twitter) or existing datasets.
  2. Clean text: lowercase, remove stop words, lemmatize, strip URLs/mentions/hashtags.
  3. Use a sentiment analyzer (e.g., VADER for social media text).
  4. Classify tweets as positive/neutral/negative and compute distributions.
  5. Visualize trends:

     * Pie chart or bar chart of sentiment categories.
     * Time series of sentiment scores over days/weeks.
* **Insights**:

  * Identify peaks in positive/negative sentiment.
  * Spot trending topics (via word clouds) tied to sentiment changes.

---

## 5]  **Traffic Accident Analysis**

* **Objective**: Find patterns in accidents related to road, weather, and time.
* **Steps**:

  1. Load accident data including timestamps, location, conditions.
  2. Clean data: fix timestamps; fill missing weather/road conditions.
  3. Feature engineering: extract hour, day-of-week, severity.
  4. Analyze:

     * Accidents by time: peak hours? night vs. day?
     * Weather patterns: rain, snow, fog ‚Üí increased accident rates?
     * Road conditions: wet vs. dry, intersection vs. highway.
  5. Visualizations:

     * **Time series** or **heatmap** of accidents by hour/day.
     * **Bar charts** for accidents by weather and road condition.
     * **Geospatial plots** (heat map or scatter) pinpointing hotspots.
* **Insights**:

  * Identify high-risk times (e.g., 5‚ÄØPM rush hour).
  * Understand how bad weather amplifies risk.
  * Highlight specific junctions or roads with frequent incidents to guide interventions.
